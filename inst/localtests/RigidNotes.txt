Notes on rigid play method:

Single primitives in BrainStem.glb sometimes combine widely separated pieces,
e.g. mesh 0 prim 41, which is the two black elbow joints in the robot.

Since rgl is slow to modify vertices, we'll do the following for triangle primitives:

 - group point triplets into single objects, and compute the average of the
 weights and joints on the whole triplet.  Split the primitive according to these averages.
