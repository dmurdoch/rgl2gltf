# rgl2gltf: Read and write .gltf and .glb files

This R package contains functions to read, write and display `.gltf` and
`.glb` files containing 3D models, following the [official spec at
khronos.org](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html)
. It also contains functions to convert `rgl` scenes and `mesh3d`
objects to and from glTF objects.

It is still in active development. Please add issues or pull requests if
something important to you is missing.

A `pkgdown` website is here: <https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl2gltf/dev/>

To install from CRAN, run

``` r
install.packages("rgl2gltf")
```

To install the development version, run

``` r

library(rgl)
library(rgl2gltf)

gltf <- readGLB("https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/master/2.0/2CylinderEngine/glTF-Binary/2CylinderEngine.glb?raw=true")
mesh <- as.mesh3d(gltf)
plot3d(gltf)
snapshot3d(webshot = FALSE, filename = "man/figures/engine.png")
```
