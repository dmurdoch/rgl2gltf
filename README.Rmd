rgl2gltf:   Read and write .gltf and .glb files
=======================================================

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README"
)
options(rgl.useNULL=FALSE)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(rgl))

if (!requireNamespace("rmarkdown", quietly = TRUE) ||
    !rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.14")) {
  warning(call. = FALSE, "These vignettes assume rmarkdown and pandoc version 1.14.  These were not found. Older versions will not work.")
  knitr::knit_exit()
}
setupKnitr(autoprint = FALSE)
```

This R package contains functions to read, write and display
`.gltf` and `.glb` files containing 3D models, following the
[official spec at khronos.org](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html) .  It also contains functions to convert
`rgl` `mesh3d` objects and scenes to and from glTF objects.

It is currently in active development.  Please add issues or pull requests if something 
important to you is missing.

A `pkgdown` website is here:  https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl2gltf/dev/

To install, run

```r
remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl2gltf")
```

Sample code:

```{r}
library(rgl)
library(rgl2gltf)

gltf <- readGLB("https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/master/2.0/2CylinderEngine/glTF-Binary/2CylinderEngine.glb?raw=true")
mesh <- as.mesh3d(gltf)
open3d(windowRect = c(0, 0, 500, 400))
shade3d(mesh)
snapshot3d(webshot = FALSE, filename = "man/figures/engine.png")
```
