# version 0.1.18

Modified mikktspace.c code for C99 compatibility.

# version 0.1.17

This is a new package, designed to support the glTF file
format with `rgl`.  Because so much code was needed I decided
to split it out into its own package.

It also contains a few miscellaneous debugging tools that
I used during development.
